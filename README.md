* E.g., to activate notepad++ from tons of your desktop windows, you simply hit `CapsLock + N` (notepad++ starts with `N`).
* Holding `CapsLock` key will bring up a alt-tab-like list allowing you to activate window by clicking.
* Clicking **always-on-top button** on the right to keep your window frontmost. 
* Try out yourself!

### Changelog
+ added different, short timeout for windows explorer
+ made default timeout longer
+ added autostart for host.ahk (can be ignored, mostly for my own convenience so that I don't loose its capabilities)
+ increased vertical size of GUI to accomodate more windows. Currently not adapting automatically, but I may look into it

+ edited README.md
